# Machine Learning based Forecasting of the Electric Mobility Uptake in Germany
## Time Series Analysis with SARIMA(X) and DeepAR Models
This repository is created for my master thesis and is intended to be available for everyone. Univariate and Multivariate Time Series Analysis with SARIMA(X) and DeepAR are implemented to achieve best possible result for my master thesis. 

The ultimate goal is to forecast the future 6 months of market share of new registration for BEV-PKW in Germany (electrical passenger cars, data source: https://www.kba.de/DE/Statistik/Fahrzeuge/Neuzulassungen/MonatlicheNeuzulassungen/monatl_neuzulassungen_node.html). 

Please feel free to share this repo. I am more than happy to receive your feedback.


Yours,

Taj
