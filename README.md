# masterthesis-time-series-analysis
This repository is created for my master thesis and is intended to be available to everyone. Univariate Time Series Analysis with SARIMA(X) and DeepAR is implemented to achieve best possible result for my master thesis. The ultimate goal is to predict the future 6 months, which is the precentage of new registration for electrical passenger cars in Germany. 

Please feel free share this repo and write your comments. I am more than happy to receive your feedback.

Yours,
Taj
