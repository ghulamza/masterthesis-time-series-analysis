# Master Thesis: Time Series Analysis with SARIMA(X) and DeepAR
This repository is created for my master thesis and is intended to be available to everyone. Univariate and Multivariate Time Series Analysis with SARIMA(X) and DeepAR are implemented to achieve best possible result for my master thesis. The ultimate goal is to forecast the future 6 months of market share of new registration for BEV-PKW in Germany (electrical passenger cars). 

Please feel free share this repo and write your comments. I am more than happy to receive your feedback.

Yours,
